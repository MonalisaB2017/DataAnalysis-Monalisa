ROW_NUMBER is a function built-in to SQL Server that will return a row number for each record in your result set

ROW_NUMBER Basics
To show the row number in SQL Server, you need to use the ROW_NUMBER function. This function is broken down in to two parts.
•	PARTITION BY – If you supply this parameter, then the row number will reset based on the value changing in the columns supplied.
This is kinda like using a GROUP BY.
•	ORDER BY – This is the specified order of the row number that you would like. 
If you wanted the order of the row number to increment by an employee name (alphabetically), you do that here.


In the following query, the results will show a row number with each record. The number will start at 1 and increment for every record 
in order of AnimalName. You can see that that the order of the row number increment is specified as a parameter in to the ROW_NUMBER()
function.

AnimalID	AnimalName	AnimalType	RowNumber
166	      Alpaca	    Mammal	    1
168	      Camel	      Mammal	    2
162	      Carabao   	Mammal	    3
171	      Cat	        Mammal	    4
163	      Cattle	    Mammal	    5
184	      Chicken	    Bird	      6
182	      Deer	      Mammal	    7
185	      Duck	      Bird	      8
186	      Goose	      Bird	      9
189	      Pigeon	    Bird	      10
188	      Quail	      Bird	      11
187	      Turkey	    Bird	      12
 
In the above example, the row number never resets. It started at 1 and kept going through all the records. 
But what if you wanted to reset the row number back to 1 based on a value changing in your result set.
In the following example, every time that the AnimalType changes we will reset the row number back to 1. 
This way, each AnimalType would have it’s own set of row numbers.
We accomplish this by listing the columns that we want to group the row numbers by in the PARTITION BY parameter.

184	      Chicken	    Bird	      1
185     	Duck	      Bird	      2
186	      Goose	      Bird	      3
189	      Pigeon	    Bird	      4
188	      Quail	      Bird	      5

162	      Carabao	    Mammal	    3
171	      Cat	        Mammal	    4
163	      Cattle	    Mammal	    5
182	      Deer	      Mammal	    6
 
 

You can specify multiple columns in the PARTITION BY and ORDER BY parameters by separating them with a comma.
