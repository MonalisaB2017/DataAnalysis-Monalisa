Differeneces between Rank() and dense_Rank()

Rank() gives ranking within ordered partition.Ties are assigned same rank with next ranking skipped.So, if you have 3 items at rank 2,
next rank listed is rank 5

Dense_Rank() gives ranking in ordered partitioned but the ranks are consecutive.No ranks are skipped if there are ranks with multiple items.


CREATE TABLE t AS
SELECT 'a' v FROM dual UNION ALL
SELECT 'a'   FROM dual UNION ALL
SELECT 'a'   FROM dual UNION ALL
SELECT 'b'   FROM dual UNION ALL
SELECT 'c'   FROM dual UNION ALL
SELECT 'c'   FROM dual UNION ALL
SELECT 'd'   FROM dual UNION ALL
SELECT 'e'   FROM dual;

SELECT
  v,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY v) row_number,
  RANK()       OVER (ORDER BY v) rank,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY v) dense_rank
FROM t
ORDER BY v;
The above will yield:

+---+------------+------+------------+
| V | ROW_NUMBER | RANK | DENSE_RANK |
+---+------------+------+------------+
| a |          1 |    1 |          1 |
| a |          2 |    1 |          1 |
| a |          3 |    1 |          1 |
| b |          4 |    4 |          2 |
| c |          5 |    5 |          3 |
| c |          6 |    5 |          3 |
| d |          7 |    7 |          4 |
| e |          8 |    8 |          5 |
+---+------------+------+------------+
In words

ROW_NUMBER() attributes a unique value to each row
RANK() attributes the same row number to the same value, leaving "holes"
DENSE_RANK() attributes the same row number to the same value, leaving no "holes"
